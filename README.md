# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The goals for this project are to build up a dataset examining the usage of the bike share program in Chicago Illinois (Divvy), and to see the relationship between that program and public transit, specifically the CTA's L system. This will be done by pulling usage data from the City Bike API before and during morning and evening rush-hour periods.

## Process
### Query City Bike API
### Match bike station locations to proximity to CTA stations via Four Square
### Join the data, sort and evalute obvious links
### Apply statistical models to check for correlations.

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
